// A Request represents an HTTP request received by a server
// or to be sent by a client.
//
// The field semantics differ slightly between client and server
// usage. In addition to the notes on the fields below, see the
// documentation for Request.Write and RoundTripper.
type Request struct {
	// Method specifies the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
	// For client requests, an empty string means GET.
	//
	// Go's HTTP client does not support sending a request with
	// the CONNECT method. See the documentation on Transport for
	// details.
	Method string

	// URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server
	// requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).
	//
	// For server requests, the URL is parsed from the URI
	// supplied on the Request-Line as stored in RequestURI.  For
	// most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be
	// empty. (See RFC 7230, Section 5.3)
	//
	// For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to
	// connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally
	// specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP
	// request.
	URL *url.URL

	// The protocol version for incoming server requests.
	//
	// For client requests, these fields are ignored. The HTTP
	// client code always uses either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
	// See the docs on Transport for details.
	Proto      string // "HTTP/1.0"
	ProtoMajor int    // 1
	ProtoMinor int    // 0

	// Header contains the request header fields either received
	// by the server or to be sent by the client.
	//
	// If a server received a request with header lines,
	//
	//	Host: example.com
	//	accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
	//	Accept-Language: en-us
	//	fOO: Bar
	//	foo: two
	//
	// then
	//
	//	Header = map[string][]string{
	//		"Accept-Encoding": {"gzip, deflate"},
	//		"Accept-Language": {"en-us"},
	//		"Foo": {"Bar", "two"},
	//	}
	//
	// For incoming requests, the Host header is promoted to the
	// Request.Host field and removed from the Header map.
	//
	// HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive. The
	// request parser implements this by using CanonicalHeaderKey,
	// making the first character and any characters following a
	// hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
	//
	// For client requests, certain headers such as Content-Length
	// and Connection are automatically written when needed and
	// values in Header may be ignored. See the documentation
	// for the Request.Write method.
	Header Header

	// Body is the request's body.
	//
	// For client requests, a nil body means the request has no
	// body, such as a GET request. The HTTP Client's Transport
	// is responsible for calling the Close method.
	//
	// For server requests, the Request Body is always non-nil
	// but will return EOF immediately when no body is present.
	// The Server will close the request body. The ServeHTTP
	// Handler does not need to.
	//
	// Body must allow Read to be called concurrently with Close.
	// In particular, calling Close should unblock a Read waiting
	// for input.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// GetBody defines an optional func to return a new copy of
	// Body. It is used for client requests when a redirect requires
	// reading the body more than once. Use of GetBody still
	// requires setting Body.
	//
	// For server requests, it is unused.
	GetBody func() (io.ReadCloser, error)

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
	// The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
	// Values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	//
	// For client requests, a value of 0 with a non-nil Body is
	// also treated as unknown.
	ContentLength int64

	// TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to
	// innermost. An empty list denotes the "identity" encoding.
	// TransferEncoding can usually be ignored; chunked encoding is
	// automatically added and removed as necessary when sending and
	// receiving requests.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close indicates whether to close the connection after
	// replying to this request (for servers) or after sending this
	// request and reading its response (for clients).
	//
	// For server requests, the HTTP server handles this automatically
	// and this field is not needed by Handlers.
	//
	// For client requests, setting this field prevents re-use of
	// TCP connections between requests to the same hosts, as if
	// Transport.DisableKeepAlives were set.
	Close bool

	// For server requests, Host specifies the host on which the
	// URL is sought. For HTTP/1 (per RFC 7230, section 5.4), this
	// is either the value of the "Host" header or the host name
	// given in the URL itself. For HTTP/2, it is the value of the
	// ":authority" pseudo-header field.
	// It may be of the form "host:port". For international domain
	// names, Host may be in Punycode or Unicode form. Use
	// golang.org/x/net/idna to convert it to either format if
	// needed.
	// To prevent DNS rebinding attacks, server Handlers should
	// validate that the Host header has a value for which the
	// Handler considers itself authoritative. The included
	// ServeMux supports patterns registered to particular host
	// names and thus protects its registered Handlers.
	//
	// For client requests, Host optionally overrides the Host
	// header to send. If empty, the Request.Write method uses
	// the value of URL.Host. Host may contain an international
	// domain name.
	Host string

	// Form contains the parsed form data, including both the URL
	// field's query parameters and the PATCH, POST, or PUT form data.
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores Form and uses Body instead.
	Form url.Values

	// PostForm contains the parsed form data from PATCH, POST
	// or PUT body parameters.
	//
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores PostForm and uses Body instead.
	PostForm url.Values
